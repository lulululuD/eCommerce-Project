In this project, I utilized data from an eCommerce platform [link](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b) to predict repurchase. The project comprises four main parts:

[Part 1](https://github.com/lulululuD/eCommerce-Project/blob/main/Part%201%20-%20Data%20Exploration%20(visualization%20%2B%20quality%20check).ipynb) - Data Exploration: This involves visualization and quality checks of the data.

[Part 2](https://github.com/lulululuD/eCommerce-Project/blob/main/Part%202%20-%20ETL%20(Create%20PostGres%20Database%20in%20Python%2C%20feature%20engineering%2C%20load%20data%20for%20modeling)%20in%20SQL.ipynb) - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Tasks include creating a Postgres database, feature engineering, and loading data for modeling in SQL.

[Part 3](https://github.com/lulululuD/eCommerce-Project/blob/main/Part%203%20-%20Data%20Preprocessing%20%2B%20Modeling%20.ipynb) - Data Preprocessing and Modeling: Utilizing techniques such as XGBoost and Random Forest to preprocess the data and build predictive models.

[Part 4](https://github.com/lulululuD/eCommerce-Project/blob/main/part%204%20Business%20Recommendation.ipynb) - Business Recommendations: Providing actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis and modeling results.
